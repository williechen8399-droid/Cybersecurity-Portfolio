## Completed: Oct 17, 2025

### Overview of Command Line
- The Command Line module provided me an essential introduction about the command-line interfaces that are applied in both Windows and Linux environments. Topics and main ideas they mentioned include the Windows Command Line, PowerShell, and Linux bash. These three core concepts of the module can greatly help professionals to navigate the system and manage files more quickly and precisely. I believe the main objective of this course is to help me establish a fundamental understanding of usage in terminal-based operation when it comes to cybersecurity work.

### Key Aspects From Command Line
- There are three key learnings from this course. The Window Command Line, PowerShell, and Linux Bash. First, let's talk about the Windows Command Line. The Windows command line is built for covering navigation and handling file operations. While PowerShell introduces powerful tools like the cmdlets with scripting methods to precisely automate tasks and retrieve data. Finally, the Linux Bash covers utilities like directory, permission handling, and the use of text-processing.
