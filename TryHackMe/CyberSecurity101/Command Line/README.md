# Command Line 

## Completed: Oct 17, 2025

### Objective
- The Command Line module introduced me to using a wide basic command lines across operating systems such as Windows and Linux systems. During the course on the Command Line, I learned how tools like Command Prompts, PowerShell, and Bash can create definite efficiency when it comes to navigating and configuring files. These are considered essential skills for cybersecurity professionals who often rely on CLI for automation and scripting.

### Key Points I Obtained
- There are three important key roles that I learned. Windows Command Line, PowerShell, and finally Linux Shells. During the learning on Windows Command Line, I've gathered concept about core commands that can make me perform super quickly when it comes to navigating directories, managing files, and performing administrative actions. PowerShell is another great tool that can greatly expand its functionality through processes like scripting, automation, and system management tools. Ultimately, Linux Shells. I came on to discover the usage and existence of Bash and other Linux shells. Those are the most important and fundamental parts in cybersecurity when running scripts and performing offensive roles like penetration testing or defending with server maintenance tasks.

### Skills Gained
- Getting in touch with these skills so many times greatly improves my comfort level when using both Windows CLI and Linux Bash environment. I've also gained much more experience, once again, when it comes to executing and combining commands for streamlined security tasking. Overall, more labs and activities of PowerShell training greatly strengthened my understanding, and made my scripting for automation and diagnostics far more efficient compared to before.
