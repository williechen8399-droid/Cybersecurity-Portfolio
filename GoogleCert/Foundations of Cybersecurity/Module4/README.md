# Module 4 - Cybersecurity Tools and Programming Languages. 
## Completed: Sept 17, 2025

### Objective
- This module introduced me to the core tools that cybersecurity analysts use on a daily basis.
I learned how SIEM systems, network analyzers, and programming languages such as SQL and Python can be applied in real-world security work,
in order to detect threats and protect systems. 

### Key Points learned
- SIEM Tools: Platforms that collect logs across different systems to alert you when something looks suspicious.

- Network Analyzers: Network analyzers are programs that capture and study network traffic. They can
can reveal strange patterns or suspicious behavior that manual monitoring might be missing.

- SQL: A language that is built for working with databases. In cybersecurity,
it's helpful when it comes to searching through data to find signs of problems and attacks.

- Python: A popular programming language that is widely used for its flexibility. Security
professionals often use it to automate repetitive work, test systems, and build easy, quick scripts.

- Cybersecurity Portfolios: Cybersecurity Portfolios is a collection of one's work and progress. Building one shows growth
over time, and gives others an opportunity to see your skills and knowledge.

### Skills Gained
-  After the course, I have confidence using basic security tools to detect and analyze threats.
-  During the course, I've gained enough experience with analyzing network traffic and spotting unusual behavior.
- Practiced using SQP queries to dig more deeply into the data fields and find issues and signals that might correspond to risks.
- Learned how Python can dramatically increase the ease of one's work when making repetitive security work by automating tasks.
- Greatly strengthened how my portfolio is structured by showing real progress and more adequate notes.
