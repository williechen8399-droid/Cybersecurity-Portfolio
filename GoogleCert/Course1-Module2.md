Module 2: The Evolution of Cybersecurity

## Overview
-In this module, I discovered that many attacks and threats can be created by threat actors, such as Social Engineering and Phishing. 
 These two attacks affecting me the most are how easily people could inadvertently expose themselves to threat actors. 
 We can easily be manipulated to fall into traps such as Social Proof Manipulation that secretly lure peoples subconscious mind to think this is trusted-
 and are in used by many others.

## Steps I Took
-Leaned about the evolution of cybersecurity and how attacks are changed overtime.
-Studied real world breaches and mistakes that caused those crisis.
-Explore how social engineering and phishing are still among the most effective attacks.

## What I learned
- Social engineering tricks
- Phishing attacks can exploit in both techical gaps and humaan weakness.
- Threat actors are adpating to new technology overtime, so defenses must keep evolving as such.

## Reflection
This module bring me the real world problem and disaster that are created among the cyber world and how effective 
those attacks and mistakes can impact very in populations. This can greatly motivates me to master both technical defense and 
awareness through out training and reviewing.
