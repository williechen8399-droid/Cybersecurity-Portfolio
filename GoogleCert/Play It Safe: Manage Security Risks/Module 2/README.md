# Module 2 = Security Frameworks and Controls
## Completed: Oct 10, 2025

### Objective
During this module, I understand the way cybersecurity frameworks and controls can create a structured approach to protect valuable information system.
I also get a better understanding of the CIA triad once again, and how frameworks like NIST and OWASP will perfectly guide professionals in identifying risks and managing them.

# Key Point Learned
- Security Frameworks: Frameworks like NIST and ISO provide well-structured guidelines for organizations to greatly manage and reduce any future cybersecurity risks more effectively.
- Controls: Security controls such as administrative, technical, and physical will be perfect defense mechanisms when it comes to protecting data and systems from any malicious threat.
- CIA Triad: The CIA triad plays a huge role in the cybersecurity field as a foundational principle to ensure data will remain confidential, accurate, and available for only authorized users.
- OWASP: OWASP stands for the Open Web Application Security Project. This concept principally focuses on identifying and reducing vulnerabilities in web applications, and dramatically helps security teams to stay proactive against serious attacks.

# Skills Gained
- Gained great learning on aligning security practices with well-established frameworks and standards.
- I've acquired throughout understanding of how security controls protect data and how they ensure great system reliability.
- This course greatly strengthened my knowledge of the concept of CIA triad and its real-world applications.
- Building awareness of how the OWASP guide organization can add the overwhelming power of defenses when it comes to ensuring web application safety.

# Reflection 
This module is about Security Frameworks and Controls, which helped me understand how cybersecurity frameworks bring structured guidelines to real-world protection.
Module 2 mentioned the CIA triad again to cite its significance in the cybersecurity field, and made me realize that security does not just involve preventing attacks, but is more about keeping information accurate, private, and available.
A better understanding of frameworks like NIST and OWASP greatly highlights how professionals also need to rely on standards to stay consistent and reduce risk across organizations.
